## Project Manager Interview Question
This repo is not maintained.


Assumptions:
- MongoDB is local
- Experts are not a separate DB model yet (model created ahead of time for future useages)
- Session does not need to be saved, as angular is a single page application, user will need to re-login on refresh
- if angular loads, and there is no projects from index call, auto seed projects


ToDos:
- List of refactoring todo's left in code comments
- Implement webpack to compile assets
- Add more styling in CSS
- Add more graceful error handling
- add unique email checking
